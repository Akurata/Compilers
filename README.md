# Compilers Class Repository - Alex Kurata

## Please Grade Branch Master...

## Deployment Plan:

~~Using a google cloud platform vm to host a Node server using express, in which I will update regularly with an interface to view my labs.~~

Since it'll probably just be easier, I simplified down my js to be only client side and should run locally though the index.html file.

## Extra Information:
* Node Version: 10.16.3
